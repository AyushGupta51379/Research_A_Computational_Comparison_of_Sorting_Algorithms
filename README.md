Capstone Research Project - A Computational Comparison of Sorting Algorithms

# Abstract

Sorting algorithms are used to sort data into order. Previous researchers have used asymptotic analysis method and considered worst running time of algorithms for comparison of sorting algorithms. This project used practical cases and considered average running
time of algorithms for comparing four sorting algorithms, namely, Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort and Quick sort. The purpose of this project was to find out the difference in practical method and theoretical method of comparing sorting algorithms. Based on
the results from this project, the practical method of comparison offers more insights on comparing sorting algorithms. In this research, Merge sort is found to be the best sorting algorithm considering the average number of operations for comparison. Further research
can be done on comparing other algorithms using the practical method of comparison from this research. The results of this project have applications in computer science, engineering, finance and economics.
